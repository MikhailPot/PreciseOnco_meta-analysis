# PreciseOnco_meta-analysis

Project Abstract

We conducted systematic review and meta-analysis in order to provide a comprehensive overview of outcomes in patients undergoing personalized genomics-based versus non-personalized treatment in oncology. The PubMed searches detected 873 studies based on phase II clinical trialsâ€™ results published from 2010 to 2021. We selected 49 studies, having 101 arms and 7012 patients for the analysis. We compared 1-year Overall Survival (OS), Progression-Free Survival (PFS), and Response Rate (RR) between genomics-based personalized and non-personalized arms. Mann-Whitney test did not detect any significant difference in 1-year OS, but RR and 1-year PFS were significantly higher in personal arms (p=0.009 and p=0.011). Medians of PFS and OS were also higher in personalized arms (p=0.018 and p=0.032). Proportional meta-analysis and meta-regression detected a significant association between personal treatment and RR. RRs were significantly higher in personal arms (p=0.037). The same results were obtained for 1-year PFS and OS rates (p=0.043 and p=0.022). There were no differences between personal and non-personal studies in subgroup analysis. Previous drug treatment, type of therapy (target/immunotherapy/cytotoxic), study design and journal impact factor did not effect on RR, PFS and OS. In the evaluated studies personalization only affected the outcomes. This study highlights the benefits of a personalized approach to cancer treatment using genomic data. Despite the limitations, the personalized approach offers hope for the development of precision oncology and improved cancer outcomes.
